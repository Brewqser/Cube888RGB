# Cube888RGB
Library for PL9823 LEDs with FRDM KL46Z in Keil uVision5 IDE. Intencionaly made for 8x8x8 cube made from thees.

# Introduction
The goal of the project is to create a relatively simple library to support programmable RGB PL9823 LEDs in the Keil uVision 5 environment with the help of the FRDM KL46Z board. The library will contain functions that allow you to initialize the necessary peripherals, send information to the diode register, set the selected colors on the diodes, display 8x8 pixelart, display the text, visually test the connected diodes, set the dimensions of the cube on which we will operate, control the mode that will be displayed on the cube .
